1. Compute the response time and turnaround time when running
three jobs of length 200 with the SJF and FIFO schedulers.

FIFO:

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job:
    Job 0 ( length = 200 )
    Job 1 ( length = 200 )
    Job 2 ( length = 200 )

    Job 0 Turnaround: 200           Job 0 Response: 0
    Job 1 Turnaround: 400           Job 1 Response: 200
    Job 2 Turnaround: 600           Job 2 Response: 400
    Turnaround: 1200 / 3 = 400      Response: 600 / 3 = 200

SJF:

The same as above since they all length(job0) < length(job1) < length(job2)
and thus they will be processed in that order(which is the same as above)



2. Now do the same but with jobs of different lengths: 100, 200, and
300.

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job:
    Job 0 ( length = 100.0 )
    Job 1 ( length = 200.0 )
    Job 2 ( length = 300.0 )

    Job 0 Turnaround: 100           Job 0 Response: 0
    Job 1 Turnaround: 300           Job 1 Response: 100
    Job 2 Turnaround: 600           Job 2 Response: 300
    Turnaround: 1000 / 3 = 333.3    Response: 400 / 3 = 133.3

SJF:

Same as above



3. Now do the same, but also with the RR scheduler and a time-slice
of 1.

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job:
    Job 0 ( length = 200.0 )
    Job 1 ( length = 200.0 )
    Job 2 ( length = 200.0 )

    Since its round robin with ts of 1 each process will switch after 1 second

    Job 0 Turnaround: 598           Job 0 Response: 0
    Job 1 Turnaround: 599           Job 1 Response: 1
    Job 2 Turnaround: 600           Job 2 Response: 2
    Turnaround: 1797 / 3 = 599      Response: 3 / 3 = 1

4. For what types of workloads does SJF deliver the same turnaround
times as FIFO?

When the jobs arrive in order of shortest length in both types of policies



5. For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SJF deliver
the same response times as RR?

If the length of each job was less than or equal to the dictated time slice for the RR policy



6. What happens to response time with SJF as job lengths increase?
Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?

As the job lengths increase, so will the response time since each job will be scheduled later relative
to its initial arrival time.

    Job 0 ( length = 100.0 )
    Job 1 ( length = 200.0 )
    Job 2 ( length = 300.0 )

    Job 0 Response: 0
    Job 1 Response: 100
    Job 2 Response: 300
    Response: 400 / 3 = 133.3


    Job 0 ( length = 200.0 )
    Job 1 ( length = 300.0 )
    Job 2 ( length = 400.0 )

    Job 0 Response: 0
    Job 1 Response: 200
    Job 2 Response: 500
    Response: 700 / 3 = 233.3



7. What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an 
equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?

As quantum lengths increase, so will the response times since each job will run longer since its time
slice increased leading to longer response times.

The worst-case response time is when each job uses its full time slice which means that the worst-case
response time for a job i where i <= N is (1 + ... + i-1) * TS where TS is the length of the time-slice.
